ECO-THRIVE-MARKET: 

The aim of the Eco Thrive Market project is to establish a comprehensive and user-friendly online marketplace that promotes sustainable living by providing a centralized platform for eco-conscious consumers to discover, compare, and purchase a diverse range of environmentally friendly products.

In-view of Techsaksham project, we have designed a website to help the Consumers as well as the customers. We used HTML, CSS for the front-end and PHP for the back-end. We also used XAMPP server as our Local Host.
